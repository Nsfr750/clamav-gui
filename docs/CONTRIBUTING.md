## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin contributing, ensure you have:

- **Python 3.10+**: For running and developing the application
- **Git**: For version control
- **ClamAV**: For testing antivirus functionality (optional for development)
- **Virtual Environment**: Recommended for development

### Fork and Clone

1. **Fork the repository** on GitHub
2. **Clone your fork** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/clamav-gui.git
   cd clamav-gui
   ```
3. **Add the upstream remote**:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/Nsfr750/clamav-gui.git
   ```
4. **Create a new branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b bugfix/description-of-fix
   ```

## Development Setup

### 1. Create Virtual Environment

```bash
# Windows
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

# Linux/Mac
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
# Install core dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install development dependencies
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
```

### 3. Verify Installation

```bash
# Test that the application runs
python -m clamav_gui --help

# Run tests
python -m pytest --version
```

### 4. Development Tools Setup

```bash
# Install pre-commit hooks (optional but recommended)
pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install

# Install code formatting tools
pip install black isort mypy
```

## Code Style and Standards

### Python Standards

- **PEP 8 Compliance**: Follow Python Enhancement Proposal 8 guidelines
- **Type Hints**: Use type annotations for all functions and methods
- **Docstrings**: Write comprehensive docstrings for all public APIs
- **Imports**: Organize imports following PEP 8 (standard library, third-party, local)

### Code Organization

- **Small Functions**: Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible
- **Clear Naming**: Use descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes
- **Error Handling**: Implement proper exception handling with meaningful messages
- **Logging**: Use appropriate logging levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR)

### GUI Development

- **PySide6 Best Practices**: Follow Qt design patterns and guidelines
- **Responsive Design**: Ensure UI works across different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Include proper labels and keyboard navigation
- **Internationalization**: Use the translation system for all user-facing text

## Testing

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
python -m pytest

# Run with coverage
python -m pytest --cov=clamav_gui

# Run specific test categories
python -m pytest -m unit          # Unit tests
python -m pytest -m integration   # Integration tests
python -m pytest -m gui           # GUI tests
python -m pytest -m performance   # Performance tests

# Run tests with verbose output
python -m pytest -v

# Run specific test file
python -m pytest tests/test_lang_manager.py
```

### Writing Tests

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and classes in isolation
- **Integration Tests**: Test how components work together
- **GUI Tests**: Use `pytest-qt` for testing PySide6 components
- **Mocking**: Use mocks for external dependencies (ClamAV, file system, etc.)

### Test Structure

```
tests/
â”œâ”€â”€ test_unit_*.py          # Unit tests
â”œâ”€â”€ test_integration_*.py   # Integration tests
â”œâ”€â”€ test_gui_*.py          # GUI component tests
â””â”€â”€ conftest.py            # Test fixtures and configuration
```

## Submitting Changes

### Branch Naming Convention

```bash
# Feature branches
feature/feature-name
feature/add-scheduled-scans

# Bug fix branches
bugfix/fix-crash-on-scan
bugfix/update-dependencies

# Documentation branches
docs/update-user-guide
docs/fix-typos
```

### Commit Guidelines

- **Clear Messages**: Use imperative mood ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
- **Atomic Commits**: Each commit should represent one logical change
- **Reference Issues**: Include issue numbers when applicable (#123)

Example commit messages:
```
feat: Add scheduled scan functionality

- Implement daily/weekly scan scheduling
- Add settings UI for scan intervals
- Update documentation

Closes #45
```
